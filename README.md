# 24challenge
Python program to solve to solve 24 challenge puzzles.

In the simplest form of 24 challenge, four integers are provided. They 
must be combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and/or 
division in a series of three steps to ulitmately arrive at the number 
24. All numbers must be used.

The purpose of this project is to explore mathematical problem-solving. 
There are various ways to solve a 24 challenge problem quickly by 
guessing and checking, but I want a solution that will solve a 24 
challenge puzzle accurately and algorithmiclly. This repo is my attempt 
to do so.

Artificial intelligence could probably sovle this problem with training, 
but where is the mathematical fun in that?
